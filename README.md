# Benfords Lov Analyse App

This app allows users to perform Benford's Law analysis on numbers extracted from a PDF file. Users can upload a PDF, and the app will display a bar chart comparing the observed frequencies of leading digits with the expected frequencies based on Benford's Law. Additionally, a table showing the count of each leading digit (1's, 2's, 3's, etc.) is provided.

## Features

- **PDF File Uploader**: Users can upload any PDF file for analysis.
- **Bar Chart Visualization**: Comparison of observed and expected frequencies of leading digits.
- **Data Table**: Shows the count of each leading digit extracted from the PDF.

## How it Works

1. **Upload a PDF**: Use the file uploader to select and upload a PDF file.
2. **Text Extraction**: The app extracts all textual content from the uploaded PDF.
3. **Number Extraction**: All numbers from the extracted text are identified.
4. **Benford's Law Analysis**: The leading digit of each extracted number is identified, and its frequency is compared against the expected frequency according to Benford's Law.
5. **Visualization**: The observed vs. expected frequencies are plotted in a bar chart. Below the chart, a table displays the count of each leading digit.

## Running the App

1. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install streamlit PyPDF2 pandas
```

2. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run your_script_name.py
```

3. Access the app in your web browser using the provided URL.

## Dependencies

- `streamlit`: For the web app interface.
- `PyPDF2`: For extracting text from PDF files.
- `pandas`: For data handling and structuring.
